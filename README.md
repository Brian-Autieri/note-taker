# Note Taker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build an Express-based application where users can take notes. In this application, users can create, save and delete notes all from one page.

## Usage

Users can follow the link to the deployed webpage to access the note taker application. Click the blue "Get Started" button to get to the notes page. Users can create a title for the note and then enter the note text below. When the note is complete, click the save icon on the top right corner of the page. The note will be saved on the left side of the page. To delete a note, click on the red trash can icon next to the note.
